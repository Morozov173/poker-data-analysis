    "#### **Summary & Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Late positions (CO & BTN) are the most profitable** because they act last post-flop.  \n",
    "✅ **Blinds (SB & BB) consistently lose money** due to forced bets and playing out of position.  \n",
    "✅ **Early positions (UTG, MP) win less** because they act first and face more uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **🔍 Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- The **Button (BTN) is the best seat** at the table—it plays the widest range profitably.  \n",
    "- The **Cutoff (CO) is also strong**, often attempting to steal blinds.  \n",
    "- **Small Blind (SB) & Big Blind (BB) are unprofitable** since they post forced bets and play out of position.  \n",
    "- **Middle positions (MP, UTG) are tighter**, meaning fewer hands are profitable from these spots.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **📈 The Impact of Sample Size**\n",
    "🔹 **The larger the sample size, the clearer these trends become.**  \n",
    "🔹 With **a small sample**, variance can make it seem like some early positions are profitable.  \n",
    "🔹 As **the number of hands increases**, the trend of **late positions winning more and blinds losing** becomes undeniable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 *This confirms that **position is crucial** in poker—late positions have a clear advantage.*  \n",
    "🔹 *Winning players adjust their strategy based on **positional strength** to maximize profits.*  \n"
